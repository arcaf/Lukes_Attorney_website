                            <p id="q1"><strong>What is credit repair</strong></p>
                            <p>Credit repair is the process of identifying errors, disputing the information 
                            in question, and monitoring the bureaus to make sure the corrections are made to 
                            your report
							</p>

                            <p id="q2"><strong>What if I have no credit?</strong></p>
                            <p>If you have no credit in most instances it is just as bad if not worse than 
                            having bad credit. Does this mean you should give up on obtaining a loan for a 
                            vehicle or a home? Absolutely not…. Everyone had to start somewhere, we weren’t 
                            born with $100k credit lines. At Credit Forget It we will take you through the 
                            steps of establishing credit, while trying to steer you away from the predatory 
                            lenders that are looking to pray off of people in your situation.
							</p>
							<p id="q3"><strong>If I have filed for bankruptcy can I still obtain credit?</strong></p>
                            <p>Yes, filing bankruptcy isn’t the end of the road. The key is to become educated 
                            so you don’t end up in a similar situation a few years from now. In many cases it 
                            is typical for someone who has had their bankruptcy discharged become eligible for 
                            financing within a year or two.
							</p>		
							<p id="q4"><strong>What if I have no money to pay my bills?</strong></p>
                            <p>With all cases of credit everything is on a case by case basis. Maybe you are currently 
                            unable to pay your bills due to an automotive or work related accident in which case a pending 
                            litigation might be able to catch you up. Or maybe you have just lost your job and have been 
                            unable to find employment. We will look at your case and if it is something that is not 
                            within our area of specialty we will advice you to seek legal counsel.
							</p>		
							<p id="q5"><strong>What's bankruptcy?</strong></p>
                            <p>Bankruptcy allows individuals or businesses (debtors) who owe others (creditors) more money 
                            than they're able to pay to either work out a plan to repay the money over time or 
                            completely eliminate (discharge) most of the bills.
							</p>	
							<p id="q6"><strong>What's the difference between secured and unsecured debt?</strong></p>
                            <p>Secured debt is a claim that's secured by some type of property, either by an agreement or involuntarily 
                            with a court judgment or taxes. Creditors can generally claim the property (and take it to pay off the debt ) 
                            in the event of bankruptcy. Unsecured debt is not tied to any type of property, and the creditor can't claim it 
                            if you file for bankruptcy. A mortgage is a secured debt on you property.
							</p>			
							<p id="q7"><strong>Which Bankruptcy type or chapter should I file?</strong></p>
                            <p>
                            Consumers typically file Chapter 13 bankruptcy, where repayment is made to creditors, or Chapter 7 
                            where the debts are dismissed. Each chapter of bankruptcy spells out:
                            <br/>
                            <ul>
                            	<li>What bills can be eliminated</li>
                            	<li>How long payments can be stretched out</li>
                            	<li>What possessions you can keep</li>
                            	<li>Additional information</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br />
							The type depends on your circumstances and if you have assets available to 
							repay all or part of the your debts. Bankruptcy laws can be tricky and involved, so determining if, 
							when and which type of bankruptcy you need should be made with careful thought or the input of a bankruptcy 
							lawyer.
							</p>	
							<p id="q8"><strong>How often can you file for bankruptcy?</strong></p>
                            <p>
                            Filing bankruptcy can adversely affect your ability to obtain future credit, 
                            rent housing and even negatively impact a job application. Any decision to file 
                            must be carefully considered.
							<br />
							<ul>
                            	<li>Chapter 7 - can be filed every 8 years from a previous Chapter 7 filing, 
                            	or 6 years from a prior Chapter 13 filing.</li>
                            	<li>Chapter 13 - can be filed 4 years from a prior Chapter 7 filing, or 
                            	2 years from a prior Chapter 13 filing.</li>

                            </ul>
							</p>
							<p id="q9"><strong>Do you have to have a certain amount of debt to file?</strong></p>
                            <p>
                            No. However, some situations may not warrant filing for bankruptcy. If your financial situation 
                            is temporary, you may consider making arrangements with individual creditors for a change in payment amounts 
                            or a reduction in the total amount due. If you have little property or money, filing bankruptcy may not be 
                            necessary, as the creditor may not be able to collect the debt.

                            <p>
                            At the offices of High Mark Legal Services we take a different approach. Using 
                            Federal laws such as the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/fair-debt-collection-practices-act-text" style="color:white; font-size: 14px; margin-left: -2.5%;">
                            Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)</a> and the 
							<a href="http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/articles/pdf/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf" style="color:white; font-size: 14px; margin-left: -2.5%;">
							Federal Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)</a>; to put the law on your side and make debt 
                            collectors legally validate the debt and prove their legal authority to collect from you. 
                            These laws were designed to protect the consumer’s rights when they engage in debt collection 
                            and also to insure that creditors report correct information regarding your accounts to the credit 
                            reporting agencies accurately.
							</p>
							<p>
							We have a proven system to help you fight back which disputes incorrect, old or inaccurate information. 
							Our procedure disputes the very account that debt collectors are attempting to collect.  We ask the debt 
							collector for proof and documentation to validate the debt they allege you owe them. We require them to 
							provide validation and proof of their legal authority to collect from you.  You’d be surprised how often 
							they simply can’t because of their lack of documentation. We then ask them to show that they have legal 
							authority to collect from you. We investigate potential violations of the <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/fair-debt-collection-practices-act-text" style=" color:white; font-size: 14px; margin-left: -2.5%;">

                             Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)</a>, which prohibits debt collectors from using abusive, unfair, or deceptive 
                             practices to collect from you.

                             <p>
                             Under the FDCPA, a debt collector is someone who regularly collects debts owed to others. This includes 
                             collection agencies, lawyers who collect debts on a regular basis, and companies that buy delinquent 
                             debts and then try to collect them

							The Federal Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)</a> is the main law for consumers and companies as it relates to the credit 
                             reporting system we have here in the United States. It not only protects consumers by specifying their rights, 
                             it also lists the responsibilities of companies who collect the credit information, distribute the credit reports, 
                             and use the information.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                             In general the FCRA covers more than just credit reporting companies such as credit bureaus. 
                             It now defines and covers all consumer reporting agencies that gather, retain, compile, issue, and use credit reports, 
                             insurance reports, employee background reports, tenant screening, bank bad check and overdraft reports, and other consumer 
                             reports based on consumer reporting information such as consumer credit experiences, court records, and other personal 
                             consumer information.
